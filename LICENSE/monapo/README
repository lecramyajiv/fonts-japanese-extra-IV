Monapo font

Most Japanese websites were designed for "MS P Gothic" font.
"Monapo" font is a combined font that uses ipagp.ttf and mona.ttf.
It has almost same width as MS P Gothic,
so it can show Japanese Ascii Art properly.

You can generate this font by fontforge.
$ cd fontforge-script/
$ ./import-ipagp.pe
